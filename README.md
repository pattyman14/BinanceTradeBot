## Module Descriptions

### Data Acquisition Module

**Functionality:**
- Connects to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Kraken) via REST APIs and WebSockets
- Retrieves real-time data: candlestick (OHLCV), order books (L2, minimum 10 levels), trade executions, tick data

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Asynchronous programming (Python's asyncio and websockets) for minimal latency
- Reconnection logic and redundant data feeds for high reliability
- Normalize data across exchanges for uniform processing

**Performance Requirements:**
